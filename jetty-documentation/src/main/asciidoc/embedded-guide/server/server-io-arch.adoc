=== Server Libraries I/O Architecture

The Jetty server libraries provide the basic components and APIs to implement a network server.

They build on the common xref:eg-arch-io[Jetty I/O Architecture] and provide server specific concepts.

The main I/O server-side class is `org.eclipse.jetty.server.ServerConnector`.

A `ServerConnector` manages a list of factories.

// TODO: here we want to be generic and talk about writing a custom factory
//  without the use of Handler. Existing factories we document elsewhere.

// TODO
